A collection of minimal apps to get myself started with React Native.

Built a few web apps with Next.JS. Goal is to port them to mobile.

* One folder for each app.
* Starting with a very basic Hello World
* Building up to something I could use in production.


| App         | Purpose                     |
|:-------------|-----------------------------|
| hello_world | Simple text       |

### Observations 

* Basic hello world app from expo template `npx create-expo-app --template expo-template-blank` is 259 MB
* press Ctrl + D (or shake your device) to open the developer menu

### Run  

Testing on iOS

* Install "Expo Go"

* cd into app dir

```
npx expo start
```

* Scan QR Code on phone
